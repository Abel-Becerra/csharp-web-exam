# Code

This document should describe how the code is structured and how the developer implemented the logic in a clear and maintainable way.

## Project Layout

> Describe how the code is organized into folders or layers and how responsibility is divided.
> 
> Example:
> - `Controllers/`: HTTP endpoints and request handling
> - `Models/`: Data transfer objects and entity definitions
> - `Views/`: Razor or MVC views for rendering UI
> - `Services/`: Application logic or helper utilities

...

## Expected Practices

> Mention the minimum design expectations and how conventions or patterns are applied.
> 
> Example:
> - Use MVC structure in the web project
> - Use ORM for data access (e.g., Entity Framework Core)
> - Apply design patterns where needed (e.g., Repository)

...

## Code Quality

> Explain what standards are expected to ensure maintainability and clarity.
> 
> Example:
> - No hardcoded values
> - Use configuration files
> - Consistent naming and scoping
> - Proper logging
> - Exceptions are handled appropriately

...

## Clarity and Documentation

> Indicate that the code should be self-explanatory and that supporting diagrams or summaries are encouraged if they improve understanding.
> 
> Example:
> - Use comments for complex logic when needed
> - UML diagrams are encouraged for non-trivial workflows
> - All parts of the application must be easy to follow for a reviewer
