# Implementation

This document should describe how to run the solution locally. It is not intended for production deployment.

## Environment Requirements

> List the OS, SDK version, tools, and anything else needed to build and run the solution.
> 
> Example:
> - Windows 10 or newer
> - .NET 6.0 SDK or greater
> - Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code

...

## Project Structure

> Describe what each top-level folder contains and how they relate to each other.
> 
> Example:
> - `api/`: ASP.NET Core Web API project
> - `web/`: Web UI project (e.g., Razor Pages or MVC Views)

...

## API Setup

> Indicate how to build and run the API, including commands and required configurations.
> 
> Example:
> ```bash
> cd api
> dotnet restore
> dotnet run
> ```

...

## Web UI Setup

> Indicate how to build and run the web project, and how it connects to the API.
> 
> Example:
> ```bash
> cd web
> dotnet restore
> dotnet run
> ```

...

## Configuration

> Mention which configuration files are required (e.g., appsettings.json), and any environment-specific values.
> 
> Example:
> - `appsettings.json`: Default values
> - `launchSettings.json`: Local development setup

...

## Notes

> Add any additional considerations, assumptions, or simplifications made in this implementation.
> 
> Example:
> - No authentication implemented
> - API base URL is hardcoded for local use
