> - Manual testing for UI interaction

...

## Execution

> Indicate how the tests can be executed and how results are verified.
> 
> Example:
> ```bash
> dotnet test
> ```
> Or run manually by navigating through the web interface

...

## Notes

> Mention any limitations or decisions taken regarding testing.
> 
> Example:
> - No automated UI tests implemented
> - Focus was on validating backend stability and integration
